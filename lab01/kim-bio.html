        My current majors are information management and technology, marketing management, and accounting. 
        I'm interested in exploring the intersections of business, technology, and design. 
        I don't have many outstanding accomplishments but when I was in high school I qualified for nationals in FBLA and got to go to Chicago. 
        In my free time, I enjoy gardening. 
        I currently have a small strawberry patch at home and I like to grow tomatoes and cucumbers in the summer. 
        I also enjoy drawing and anything related to the arts.
